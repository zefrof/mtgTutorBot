**I consider this bot feature complete. That means the only updates moving forward will be bug fixes.**

To get started type @mtgtutorbot "card name". Then you can select to send the card's picture, text, buy link, or price. Add an <&> with the 3/4 character set code to grab a specific printing of a card. Put an <!> in front of the card name to tutor a card by its exact name. Useful for cards with common words for names like *Sleep* and *Shock*.

The command "/start" will introduce you to the app.

The command "/help" will tell you where to get help and report bugs.
